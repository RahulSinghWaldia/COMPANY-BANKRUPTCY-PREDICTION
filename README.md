# Company Bankruptcy Prediction Data Science Project
## Overview
This data science project focuses on predicting the likelihood of company bankruptcy using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify companies as either financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. By leveraging historical financial data and relevant features, we aim to provide insights and predictions to assist stakeholders, such as investors and financial institutions, in making informed decisions.

## Project Steps
## 1. Data Collection
Collect a comprehensive dataset of financial and non-financial attributes for a range of companies, including those that have experienced bankruptcy and those that have not. Gather data from reliable sources, such as financial databases, public records, or business intelligence platforms. Ensure the dataset covers a significant time period and contains relevant features for analysis. Link to dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction

## 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
Explore the dataset to understand the available variables, their distributions, and any missing or inconsistent data. Identify outliers and handle missing values through techniques like imputation or deletion. Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant or duplicate entries to ensure data quality.

## 3. Feature Selection and Engineering
Select relevant features that have a significant impact on company bankruptcy prediction. Consider financial ratios, profitability indicators, liquidity measures, solvency ratios, and other relevant financial attributes. Additionally, engineer new features based on domain knowledge or financial expertise that may provide additional insights into a company's financial health.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for analysis. Perform transformations such as data normalization or standardization if required. Encode categorical variables appropriately. Split the data into training and validation sets to ensure unbiased evaluation of the models.

## 5. Model Selection
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for bankruptcy prediction. Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM. Consider the algorithm's interpretability, performance, and suitability for binary classification tasks.

## 6. Model Training and Evaluation
Train the selected model using the preprocessed dataset. Utilize techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Adjust the model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## 7. Model Validation
Validate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its generalization capabilities. Evaluate the model's performance on unseen companies and compare it to the validation results obtained during training. This step ensures that the model performs well on new, unseen data.

## 8. Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model to predict the likelihood of company bankruptcy. Develop a user-friendly interface or integrate the model into an existing financial analysis system. Provide clear instructions on how to utilize the model for bankruptcy prediction.

## 9. Performance Analysis and Reporting
Analyze the performance of the bankruptcy prediction model and interpret the results. Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. Report the findings and communicate the insights derived from the model's predictions. Provide a comprehensive report documenting the methodology, results, and limitations of the project.

## Conclusion
The company bankruptcy prediction data science project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of company bankruptcy. By leveraging data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can provide insights and predictions to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions. The project's documentation and code can be shared on GitHub, allowing others to learn and apply bankruptcy prediction techniques in their own projects.
